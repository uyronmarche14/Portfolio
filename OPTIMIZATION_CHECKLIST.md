## Verification Steps

### Before Deployment

1. **Run Quality Checks**:

   ```bash
   npm run quality:check
   ```

2. **Analyze Bundle Size**:

   ```bash
   npm run build:analyze
   ```

3. **Check Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm run deps:unused
   ```

4. **Run Cleanup Analysis**:

   ```bash
   npm run cleanup
   ```

5. **Test Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

### Performance Verification

1. **Lighthouse Audit**: Run Lighthouse on production build
2. **Bundle Size**: Verify bundle size is within limits
3. **Load Time**: Test page load times
4. **Core Web Vitals**: Check LCP, FID, CLS metrics

### Security Verification

1. **Security Headers**: Verify all security headers are present
2. **Dependency Audit**: Run `npm audit` for vulnerabilities
3. **Content Security Policy**: Test CSP configuration
