# Content Directory

This directory contains static content, data files, and content management logic.

## Purpose

- Store static content and data files
- Manage content that doesn't require database storage
- Organize content by type and feature

## Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for data files when possible
- Keep content separate from business logic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Consider internationalization for text content
